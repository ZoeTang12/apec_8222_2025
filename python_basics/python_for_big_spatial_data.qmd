# Overview for today

- Yesterday, we connected to GitHub and gave a brutally quick introduction to Python.
- Today we’re going to:
    - Pickup where we left off
    - Learn more about Numpy
    - Learn about spatial data in Python
    - Do raster-math “at scale”
    - If there’s time, start into our first Machine Learning model
